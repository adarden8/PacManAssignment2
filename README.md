# PacMen Exercise 
## Week 7: MITxPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN

### Description
The second Pacman assignment was part of a self-study project. The task was to implement a PacMan game in which multiple PacMan could be created with the press of a button and operate at randomly generated speeds. This was done to gain practice manipulating the DOM using techniques learned during this week. 

### How to Run 
Forking and downloading the four images, index.html, and pacmen.js will give others access to the PacMen program. Simply open the html file in your browser and have fun making multiple PacMen! 

### Future Improvements
Going forward with this project, I'd like to test manipulating not only the random speed and placement of the PacMen but also altering the size of each PacMen.
